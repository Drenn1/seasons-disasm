This is a partial disassembly of Oracle of Seasons. It's meant to assemble correctly and
give me a place to work on seasons-specific stuff. However, eventually seasons-specific
stuff will be moved into the ages-disasm repository (which will then be renamed
oracles-disasm?).

This depends heavily on files from ages-disasm.
